 * The whole product is itself a Block (`rootBlock`) — you're always inside
 * *some* block, even at the very top, so "the current system's interface"
 * always means "this container's own ports," root included. `path` is the
 * list of block ids from the root down to whichever level is currently
 * being viewed/edited; every method below (listBlocks, addBlock,
 * addConnection, ...) transparently operates on *that* level's children,
 * so callers never need to know whether they're at the root or three
 * levels deep. getBlock() additionally resolves the container itself (not
 * just its children), since selecting "the current system" to edit its
 * interface means selecting a block that isn't one of its own children.
